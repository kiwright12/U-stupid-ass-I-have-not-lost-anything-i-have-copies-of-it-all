U-stupid-ass-I-have-not-lost-anything-i-have-copies-of-it-all
Everything u have tried to do has failed bur ur too stupid to c what is going  on ...do u think  I have  let u be on all my equipment without doing anything about u trying ur hardest to steal everything I have? U could delete everything online that u think  will get deleted i wait all from the 4 laptops and 5 phones i know  about lol keep going 

this is for the  community to read and if and when the right person contacts me I will give them a copy  of everything as u sir are a scumbag the laceless clown this message is for has stolen all my ai projects thinking he is smart but never realised what or he could still access me his little party trick is quite  a story and if my plan here works and people see this I will  tell all to who wants to know in the meantime I will be contacting all the companies he has violated along with a guide to what's  going on because Mr unic**t over here is really thinking he is doing stuff 

I have all the computer files he injects in to his victims computers, phones,cloud and one drives even the project he planning to steal ...feel free to reach out im more than willing to help this account is also covered in lovely little surprises if ur willing to look security concerns are rife he has breached github, copilot, onedrive, android, visual studio, google ai studio, Gemini, WiFi and network connections, computer registeries, task schedule, malicious code hidden in project files, all, exe, virtual desktop, media and iso images.....I could go on but do I need to i have proof of it all on usb and actual laptops 

the person doing this has and will target your identity and attempt to access your bank, binance accounts, coinbace amongst other things is financial struggle is a real problem I'll give some information he or she will attack your phone in many ways to put out of service, delete, divert and silence notifications messages phone calls and contacts to disable one of your security factors then aim to gain your  email through the same  tactics i advice biometrics they will also infiltrate your Google adsense with a sly different method and will  attempt to ues and sync with a cloud account you don't use im saying this to warn people of early signs of attac, the cloud attack is triggered and injected wit a system file .dll name but contains malicious code. that  file is will share for free as soon as ppl pay  attention.
